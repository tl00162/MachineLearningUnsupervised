Rocuses on unsupervised learning techniques applied to a wine dataset. It includes clustering analysis using K-means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering. The project explores optimal cluster counts via silhouette analysis and investigates the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance. Ideal for those studying clustering algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and the effects of high-dimensional data on clustering accuracy.
